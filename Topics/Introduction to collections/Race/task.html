<p>Imagine that there is an international car race. Each country is represented by two racers. You decide to store the information about the race using collections. When a racing car crosses the finish line, you record the team it represents. As a result, we should know in what order the cars arrived at the finish line.<br/>
What type of collection would you use to store this information?</p>
