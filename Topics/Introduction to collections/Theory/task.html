<p>Sometimes only one variable with a number or a string is not enough, and we need a bunch of them in one place. In these cases the programming languages often use collections. If you are not familiar with collections, do not worry, in this step, we start talking about them.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-a-collection">What is a collection? </h5>
<p>Collections are containers that support various ways to store and organize different objects and make them easily accessible. A collection usually contains a number of objects (this number may be zero) of the same type. Objects in a collection are called <strong>elements</strong> or<strong> items</strong>. Collections are an implementation of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10390" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an abstract data structure is a high-level concept used to describe the organization and manipulation of data. | It is a blueprint for collections, which are container objects that store and manage elements or items of the same type. Abstract data structures support various operations, such as retrieving, removing, changing, or replacing elements, and adding new elements. However, it is important to note that some of these operations, like adding, removing, or changing elements, only apply to mutable collections. Immutable collections, which cannot be changed, only allow operations that do not modify the elements, such as accessing them.">abstract data structures</a> that can support the following operations:</p>
<ul><li><p>retrieving an element;</p></li><li><p>removing an element;</p></li><li><p>changing or replacing an element;</p></li><li><p>adding a new element.</p></li></ul>
<p>However, it is important to note that operations like adding, removing, and changing elements only apply to <strong>mutable</strong> collections. Let's try to understand what this means.</p>
<h5 id="mutability">Mutability</h5>
<p>Collections can be <strong>mutable</strong> or <strong>immutable</strong>.</p>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10390" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable collection is a type of collection that, once created, cannot be modified. | This means that you cannot add, remove, or update elements in an immutable collection.

That is, they only allow those operations that do not change the elements, such as accessing an element. Immutability<em> </em>can be helpful when you want to store items together without allowing them to be modified in the future. By using immutable collections, you can be sure that the contents of the collection will not change over time. For example, you may have a list of pages in a book that cannot be changed.<br/><br/>Mutable collections also let you access the elements, but in addition, they allow operations that change the content of a collection by adding, removing, or updating the stored items. For example, you may have a collection of favorite restaurants that can change over time.</p>
<h5 id="collections-in-kotlin">Collections in Kotlin </h5>
<p>Kotlin Standard Library provides the implementation for the basic types of collections: <strong>list</strong>, <strong>set</strong>, and <strong>map</strong>. All three exist<strong> </strong>in <strong>mutable</strong> and <strong>immutable</strong> variations. Before we consider each type in detail, let's have a quick overview.</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">List</code> stores elements in a specified order and provides indexed access to them.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> stores unique elements whose order is generally undefined.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> stores <strong>key-value</strong> pairs (entries); keys are unique, but different keys can be paired with equal values.</p></li></ul>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">List</code> is a container that keeps the elements of a given type in the same order in which they were added. Also, <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> allows duplicate elements. So, if you want to store items in the order of their insertion, and it doesn't matter to you that they can be repeated, use <code class="language-kotlin">List</code>. For example, you could store student rating history in a <code class="language-kotlin">List</code>.<br/><br/>The difference between <code class="language-kotlin">List</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> is that the latter does not allow duplicates: all elements in a <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> are unique. So, if you try to add an already existing element to a set, you will simply overwrite it. Also, <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> does not maintain the order. So, if you don't want to have duplicates and the order doesn't really matter, <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> is the best option. For example, you could use <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code> to collect the names of your favorite restaurants or people you invited to your party.</p>
<p>Finally, <code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> stores elements as key-value pairs. Each key is assigned a specific value that you set. <code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> does not allow duplicate keys but allows duplicate values. If you try to add a new key-value pair and the key is already present in the current map, you will simply overwrite its value. Similarly to <code class="language-kotlin">Set</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> does not store elements in the order they were inserted. If you want to store key-value pairs,  <code class="language-kotlin">Map</code> is the best option for you. For example, you could store people's names as keys and their job titles as values.</p>
<p>Last but not least: you can combine different types in a collection if your task requires it. That's why we refer to Kotlin collections as <strong>generic</strong><em>.</em></p>
<h5 id="common-properties-and-methods-for-collections">Common properties and methods for collections</h5>
<p>As you can see, collections are quite different in structure and application. However, there are properties and methods that can be used with any collection:</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">size</code> returns the size of your collection.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">contains(element)</code> checks if the element is in your collection.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">containsAll(elements)</code> checks if all elements of the collection <code class="language-kotlin">elements</code> are in your collection.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">isEmpty()</code> shows whether the collection is empty or not.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">joinToString()</code> converts the collection to a string.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">indexOf(element)</code> returns the index of the first entry of the <code class="language-kotlin">element</code>, or -1 if the element is not in the collection.</p></li></ul>
<p>In addition, all mutable collections have some common methods. You can use them with any mutable collection, but they cannot be used with an immutable collection:</p>
<ul><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">clear()</code> removes all elements from the collection.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">remove(element)</code> removes the first occurrence of an element from your collection.</p></li><li><p><code class="language-kotlin">removeAll(elements)</code> removes from your collection all elements contained in the collection <code class="language-kotlin">elements</code>.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="idiom">Idiom</h5>
<p>Another way to check if an item is contained in a collection is to use the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">in</code>. You may have already seen this if you've studied ranges. If not, no problem â€“ it works just like the <code class="language-kotlin">contains()</code> function. Look at the example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(elem in collection)

println(collection.contains(elem))</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code class="language-kotlin">in</code> keyword makes code easier to read. You should use <code class="language-kotlin">in</code> instead of <code class="language-kotlin">contains()</code>, as it is recommended in the documentation on <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html#check-the-presence-of-an-element-in-a-collection" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kotlinlang.org</a>.  </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h5>
<p>This should be enough for the first acquaintance with Kotlin collections. Sometimes using a <code class="language-kotlin">MutableList</code> simply does not fit the task, so it's important to know how to work with other collections. Now you know what collections are, what main operations they allow, and what types of collections Kotlin provides.</p>
