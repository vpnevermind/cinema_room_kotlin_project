<p>Sometimes, you need to repeat a group of statements several times. You can just copy-paste the expression. What if you want to repeat it one hundred thousand times? Copy-paste is clumsy in this case.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, Kotlin provides several special <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4643" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a statement is a single command to be executed, such as printing a text or assigning a value to a variable. | Unlike expressions, which produce a single value as a result of computation, statements are standalone commands that have a side effect, like changing the state of the program. The result of a statement is not used in the program, whereas the result of an expression often is. For example, in the statement `val x = 2 * 2`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the variable `x`. However, the result of the statement itself is not used in the program. In contrast, if you write `println(2 * 2)`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is passed directly to the `println` function, which then prints the result. It's important to note that a statement can be an expression, but not all expressions are statements. For instance, `2 * 2` is an expression, but it's not a statement because it doesn't change the state of the program.">statements</a> to repeat <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4643" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a block of code is a group of zero or more statements enclosed in a pair of curly braces. | It is a fundamental part of the language's syntax and can be used in various contexts such as function bodies, control structures, and exception handling. Blocks can contain any number of statements, and they allow for the grouping and organization of code. For example, when handling exceptions in Kotlin, you can use a block to specify the code to be executed when an exception occurs.">blocks of code</a> multiple times. These statements are known as <strong>loops</strong>. They are useful when it comes to repeating multiple statements.</p>
<h5 id="repeat-loop">Repeat loop</h5>
<p>To use the simplest loop, write <code class="language-kotlin">repeat(n)</code> and a sequence of statements in curly braces <code class="language-kotlin">{...}</code>. <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> is an integer that determines how many times these statements are going to be repeated.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">repeat(n) {
    // statements
}</code></pre>
<p>For example, the program below prints <code class="language-kotlin">Hello</code> three times:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    repeat(3) {
        println("Hello")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Hello
Hello
Hello</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> is zero or a negative number, Kotlin will ignore the loop. If <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> is one, the statements will be executed only once.</p>
<p>Kotlin has the opportunity to control the current iteration with the <code class="language-kotlin">it</code> name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    repeat(3) {
        println(it)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Output: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">0
1
2</code></pre>

For instance, you can call a function directly or by passing its value using a function reference. Lambda expressions have a reasonable type, just like top-level functions.

<h5 id="reading-and-processing-data-in-a-loop">Reading and processing data in a loop</h5>
<p>You can read data from the standard input, declare variables and even perform calculations inside the <code class="language-kotlin">repeat</code> statement.</p>
<p>Take a look at this example. The program below reads numbers from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4643" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a standard input is a stream of data that goes into a program, supported by the operating system. | It typically obtains data from the keyboard, but can also be obtained from a file. While not all programs need to use standard input, it is still commonly used. The standard input is often used in a typical problem-solving approach of reading data from the standard input, processing it to obtain a result, and outputting the result to the standard output. In Kotlin, to read data from the standard input, you can use the `readLine()` function, which reads the whole line as a string.">standard input</a> and calculates their sum. The first number is not a part of the sum, it determines the length of the input sequence.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {    
    val n = readln().toInt()
    var sum = 0
    
    repeat(n) {
        val next = readln().toInt()
        sum += next
    }
    
    println(sum)
}</code></pre>
<p>This code reads a length of a number sequence and assigns it to the <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> variable. After that, it creates a variable to store the total sum. The code reads the next number and adds it to the sum exactly <code class="language-kotlin">n</code> times. Then, the loop stops, and the program prints the total sum.</p>
<p>Here is an example of input numbers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">5
40
15
30
25
50</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">160</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Loops are useful when you need to repeat a statement in your code. In this topic, we have discussed the <code class="language-kotlin">repeat()</code> loop. It is a very simple tool. Define the number of executions, then the statement in curly braces, and off you go! In the next lesson, we will learn about advanced loops and how they can be applied to more complex issues.</p>
