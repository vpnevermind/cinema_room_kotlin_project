<p>Sometimes, it isn't enough to use <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code> to read data from <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4445" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a standard input is a stream of data that goes into a program, supported by the operating system. | It typically obtains data from the keyboard, but can also be obtained from a file. While not all programs need to use standard input, it is still commonly used. The standard input is often used in a typical problem-solving approach of reading data from the standard input, processing it to obtain a result, and outputting the result to the standard output. In Kotlin, to read data from the standard input, you can use the `readLine()` function, which reads the whole line as a string.">standard input</a>. <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code> is a simple method, not suitable for complex tasks, for example: find only <code class="language-kotlin">Integers</code> or only <code class="language-kotlin">Doubles</code> in a data flow, read data sequentially, word by word, and control such reading step by step. In this topic, you will learn to use one of Java tools that can be also used in Kotlin — <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code>.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-java-scanner">What is Java Scanner?</h5>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4445" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a scanner is a tool borrowed from the Java library for reading data from standard input. | It is used when the `readLine()` function is not sufficient for complex tasks, such as reading data sequentially word by word, or finding specific patterns in a data flow. The scanner allows a program to read values of different types (strings, numbers, etc.) from standard input. To use it, you need to add an import statement for the `Scanner` class at the beginning of your source code file.">Scanner</a> is another way to obtain data from standard input. You can access it directly from Kotlin because it is interoperable with other Java libraries. <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> allows a program to read values of <strong>different types </strong>(strings, numbers, etc.) from standard input.</p>
<p>To use it, you need to add the following import statement to the top of your file with the source code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.Scanner</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.*</code></pre>
<p>You can use either method to add <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> to your program. We will discuss importing in more detail later.</p>
<p>Let's create a variable initialized by <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val scanner = Scanner(System.`in`)</code></pre>
<p>In this line, <code class="language-kotlin">System.`in`</code> is an object that represents <strong>the standard <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4445" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an input stream is a way to read data from a source, such as the standard input, a file, or a network connection. | It's a sequence of bytes that can be read and processed by a program. The `readLine()` function in Kotlin is an example of an input stream, as it reads a line of text from the standard input and returns it as a string. The `Scanner` class, which is interoperable with the Java library, is another way to obtain data from the standard input and read values of different types. When you're done with an input stream, it's important to close it to free up system resources.">input stream</a></strong>. <code class="language-kotlin">scanner</code> wraps it as an internal data source and provides a set of convenient methods to work with it. Sure, you can use <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner(System.`in`)</code> in your code instead of creating a <code class="language-kotlin">scanner</code> variable, but using a single variable is a more convenient and readable way to do it.</p>
<p>Now we can read data from standard input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val line = scanner.nextLine() // read a whole line, e.g., "Hello, Kotlin"
val num = scanner.nextInt()   // read a number, e.g., 123
val string = scanner.next()   // read a string, e.g., "Hello"</code></pre>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><code class="language-kotlin">scanner.next()</code> reads only <strong>one word</strong>, not a line. If the user enters <code class="language-kotlin">Hello, Kotlin</code>, it will read <code class="language-kotlin">Hello,</code>.</p></div>
<p>After you call <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.nextLine()</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.nextInt()</code> or something similar, the program will anticipate input data. Here is an example of correct input data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Hello, Kotlin
123 Hello</code></pre>
<p>The input example below is also valid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Hello, Kotlin
123
Hello</code></pre>
<p>It's possible to read a number as a string using <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.next()</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.nextLine()</code> if the number is on a new line.</p>
<p>Also, the <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> type provides several methods (functions) for reading values of other types. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Class Scanner</a> documentation for more details.</p>
<p>The program below reads two numbers and outputs them in reverse order on two different lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.Scanner // a class (type) from the Java standard library

fun main() {
    val scanner = Scanner(System.`in`) // reads data

    val num1 = scanner.nextInt() // reads the first number
    val num2 = scanner.nextInt() // reads the second number

    println(num2) // prints the second number
    println(num1) // prints the first number
}</code></pre>
<p>Ok, now we've read the data and don't need <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> anymore. When we used <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code>, we just proceeded with our code and moved further. But <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> can consume PC resources all the time. To stop it, we need to use the method <code class="language-kotlin">close()</code>, which... cancels <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code>:)</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">scanner.close()</code></pre>
<p>Now we are good.</p>
<h5 id="custom-delimiter">Custom delimiter</h5>
<p>One important thing: we can input data directly in <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code>. Let's see:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val scanner = Scanner("123_456")</code></pre>
<p>But how can we read next word if we don't have whitespaces or new lines? For these cases, <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> has a convenient tool — <code class="language-kotlin">useDelimiter()</code>. With its help, we can customize our <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4445" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a delimiter is a character or a sequence of characters that separates the elements of a string. | It is used to split a string into substrings based on the specified delimiter. The default delimiter is a whitespace. By customizing the delimiter, you can read data differently. For instance, you can use a comma or a colon as a delimiter to read words or integer values separately. The `split()` function is used to divide a string into substrings by a separator, and it returns a list of those substrings.">delimiters</a> for methods like <code class="language-kotlin">next()</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">nextInt()</code>, etc. (the default value of delimiter is a whitespace).</p>
<p>To read these words and integers separately, we have to set a new delimiter symbol – <code class="language-kotlin">"_"</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">scanner.useDelimiter("_")</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can read this data:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(scanner.nextInt()) // 123
println(scanner.nextInt()) // 456</code></pre>
<p>Cool!</p>
<h5 id="check-next-element">Check next element</h5>
<p>Suppose we have the following data on our Scanner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val scanner = Scanner("Hello, Kotlin!")</code></pre>
<p>Now, we try to read several words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val word1 = scanner.next()
val word2 = scanner.next()
val word3 = scanner.next()</code></pre>
<p>When we try to read the third word, we'll receive an exception and our program will <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4445" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a crash refers to a situation where a program terminates abnormally due to a run-time error. | A run-time error is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, as opposed to a compile-time error that is caught during the compilation process. A crash can be caused by two main types of run-time errors: logic errors and unhandled exceptions. Logic errors occur when a program produces an incorrect result due to incorrect code, while unhandled exceptions include errors such as division by zero, file not found, and others. When a crash occurs, a stack trace is generated, which provides information about the program state and the sequence of function calls that led to the error.">crash</a>. What can we do with that? Huh, <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> has its own method for such a situation – it is called <code class="language-kotlin">hasNext()</code> (<code class="language-kotlin">hasNextInt()</code>, etc). </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">if (scanner.hasNext()) val word1 = scanner.next() // Hello,
if (scanner.hasNext()) val word2 = scanner.next() // Kotlin!
if (scanner.hasNext()) val word3 = scanner.next() // It doesn't work but also doesn't make error</code></pre>
<p>Now, we are able to read data or not to read it if our data flow has ended.</p>
